# Logging Issues Fix Summary

## Problems Identified

From the H100 training output, several logging issues were observed:

1. **Incorrect Loss Display**: Progress logs showed `Loss: 0.0000` while actual loss was `6.2524`
2. **Incorrect Learning Rate**: Progress logs showed `LR: 0.00e+00` while actual LR was `5.928853754940712e-08`
3. **Inconsistent Metrics**: Mismatch between progress logs and actual training metrics
4. **NaN Handling**: Gradient norm showing as `nan` without proper handling

## Root Causes

1. **Wrong Log Key**: Code was looking for `train_loss` but HuggingFace Trainer logs under `loss`
2. **Missing Fallbacks**: No proper fallback when log entries were missing
3. **NaN Values**: No handling for NaN values in gradient norms
4. **Timing Issues**: Log history might not be immediately available

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Log Key Access (`training/trainer.py`)
```python
# Before: Only looked for 'train_loss'
current_loss = latest_log.get('train_loss', 0.0)

# After: Check both 'loss' and 'train_loss' with proper fallbacks
current_loss = latest_log.get('loss', latest_log.get('train_loss', self.training_engine.metrics.train_loss))
```

### 2. Enhanced Metrics Update (`on_log` method)
```python
# Handle both 'loss' and 'train_loss' keys
if 'loss' in logs:
    self.training_engine.metrics.train_loss = logs['loss']
elif 'train_loss' in logs:
    self.training_engine.metrics.train_loss = logs['train_loss']
```

### 3. Added NaN Handling
```python
# Handle NaN and invalid values
if current_loss is None or (isinstance(current_loss, float) and (current_loss != current_loss)):
    current_loss = 0.0
if current_lr is None or (isinstance(current_lr, float) and (current_lr != current_lr)):
    current_lr = 0.0
```

### 4. Improved Tokens/Second Calculation
```python
# More accurate calculation using actual config values
seq_length = self.training_engine.config.max_length
batch_size = args.per_device_train_batch_size * args.gradient_accumulation_steps
tokens_processed = batch_size * seq_length
self.training_engine.metrics.tokens_per_second = tokens_processed / step_time
```

## Testing

Created `test_logging_fix.py` to validate the fixes:
```bash
python test_logging_fix.py
```

## Expected Results

After the fix, training logs should show:
- **Correct Loss Values**: Actual training loss (e.g., `Loss: 6.2524`)
- **Correct Learning Rate**: Actual LR values (e.g., `LR: 5.93e-08`)
- **Proper NaN Handling**: No display issues with NaN values
- **Consistent Metrics**: Progress logs match actual training metrics

## Example Fixed Output
```
Step 50/75897 (0.1%) | Loss: 6.2524 | LR: 5.93e-08 | Tokens/s: 150000 | ETA: 600.0min
```

Instead of the previous incorrect:
```
Step 50/75897 (0.1%) | Loss: 0.0000 | LR: 0.00e+00 | Tokens/s: 150000 | ETA: 600.0min
```

## Backward Compatibility

The fixes maintain backward compatibility with:
- Different HuggingFace Trainer versions
- Various GPU types (RTX 4050, L4, A100, H100)
- Different logging configurations
- Both streaming and non-streaming datasets
